# Hello Holberton!

## This is a ~~project~~ *repository of projects* ~~to~~ *which* demonstrate that I know how to use vi*, emacs, and vagrant*.

### I ~~am making~~ *made the first version of* this README file with vi*, and added these edits with emacs, all while using vagrant!*.

#### Hopefully, that means I know how to use vi*, emacs, and vagrant.*~~, even if I can't pronounce it...~~ ####

##### Thank you for watching, see you next time. ######
